Good Merchant is a smartphone application. This allows customers to find the best price accessible on the web simply by clicking an image of a product or the image of the item's name. A picture may be scanned on any platform or device. Good Merchant gives aggregative information, and it will generate a list of viable channels from around the web and provide it to the user in a user-friendly manner. After selecting a channel from the list, the user may navigate straight to it.

# Features

# Inspiration
Before buying a product it's a good idea to search about it on web. Maybe you can find it somewhere at a lower cost or better quality. So our idea was to help user get
other options to choose or get an idea about the product they are buying.
