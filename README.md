# Description
 <p>Good Merchant is an android application that allows customers to find the best price accessible on the web simply by clicking an image of the product or the product's     
 name/brand the customer wants to search for or select the desired image from the gallery. The customer can also do a manual search by entering the product name or by providing 
 the product image URL. Good Merchant gives aggregative information, and it will generate a list of viable channels from around the web and offer it to the user in a user-
 friendly manner. After selecting a track from the list, the user may navigate straight to it.</p>

# Inspiration
 Before buying a product it's a good idea to search about it on web. Maybe you can find it somewhere at a lower cost or better quality. So our idea was to help user get
 other options to choose or get an idea about the product they are buying.
