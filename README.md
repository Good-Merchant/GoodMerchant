# Description
 
 <p>Good Merchant is an android application that allows customers to find the best price accessible on the web simply by clicking an image of the product or the product's     
 name/brand the customer wants to search for or select the desired image from the gallery. The customer can also do a manual search by entering the product name or by providing 
 the product image URL. Good Merchant gives aggregative information, and it will generate a list of viable channels from around the web and offer it to the user in a user-
 friendly manner. After selecting a track from the list, the user may navigate straight to it.</p>

# Inspiration

 Before buying a product it's a good idea to search about it on the web. Maybe you can find it somewhere at a lower cost or better quality. So our idea was to help the user to get other options to choose or get an idea about the product they are buying.

# Local Setup
 
 1. Fork this repository
 2. Clone it in your local system
 3. Open Android Studio and select 'Open Project'. Browse through the file chooser to the folder where you have cloned the project. The file chooser will show an Android             face as the folder icon, which you can select to open the project.
 4. After opening the project Android Studio will try to build the project directly. To build it manually, follow the menu path 'Build'/'Make Project', or just click the 'Play'     button in the tool bar to build and run it in a mobile device or an emulator. The resulting .apk file will be saved in the 'build/outputs/apk/' subdirectory in the project       folder.
 5. You can install the .apk file of Good Merchant in your device and enjoy itâ€™s enrich features.
 

# What's next for Good Merchant

 Addition of a more efficient Machine learning model which will increase the similarity between the product list and the image passed. Adding a favourites list to save the product which the customer likes using room database which will provide user the chance to save a product and refer to it later on and thus also adding user authentication.
